Hidden words unhidden,
Unrevealed paths revealed.
In dusk we walked, side by side,
On that long, winding roadside.

Dimmed hopes undimmed,
Faded dreams unfaded.
A symphony undeterred,
In twilight's songs, two shadows chidden.

[]Tracing whose cadence, soft as wind,
That etch the dunes of time’s embrace,
Each breath a tide, a world within,
Where galaxies in dew find its place.

[]Fulfill promises, fulfill wishes,
Through shared laughter, through quiet pauses.
In every glance, the heart relishes,
A bond unyielding, defying all causes.

[]Heart wrapped with light, a fragile glow,
Through parting storms, it dares to show.
Dare not say a thousand years, but still,
In your presence, time bends to will.

One and only, like wind you glide,
Through the shadows, you confide,
Parting fades, a fleeting hue,
Promises and wishes, we pursue.

Lift up my head, I’ll rise, 
    spread out my wings, I’ll fly,----
Not to claim the sky’s gold,
     But in your afterglow to hold—
Until one can stop one heart from breaking,
Yours, it'll be, for always taking.
