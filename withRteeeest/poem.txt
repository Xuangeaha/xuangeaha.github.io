Wind roads unwind,
Silent paths unsilent.
Through asphalt's dusk
    dusk where two shadows blend.

Hidden words rehidden,
Still breath restilled.
Heart wrapped in light
    light of sanctuary ascend.

After rain, stage-lit rain,
    Back to back, silhouettes remain.
Spotlights trace, voices entwined——
    Crowd dissolved, the world unwinds.

Moments slip on a shared drift,
    melody whispers through midnight's rift.
She says the rain holds unshed tears,
    I count raindrops as time disappears.

Tracing whose cadence, faint as starlight,
    whose one and only dunes in time's embrace;
Under sea of clouds, with world's gift alight,
    where galaxies in dew find their place.

Fulfill promises, fulfill wishes,
    Through moments bright, through quiet pauses.
Dare not say a thousand years, but still,
    In whose presence, time bends to will.

Lift up my head, I'mma rise
    to the horizon's hymn,
        where night's last sigh
    dance on daybreak's rim;
Spread out my wings, I'mma fly
    like wind carry what cannot say,
        through veils of mist
    toward breath of unborn day.
    
Yet not to claim the sky's gold,
    but in whose afterglow to hold.
Two shadows merge where once was one——
    a fugue of shadows, on road not taken.
Till one can stop one heart from breaking,
    Yours, it'll be, for always taking.
