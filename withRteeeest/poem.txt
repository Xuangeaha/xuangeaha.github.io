Hidden words unhidden,
Unrevealed paths revealed.
In dusk we walked, side by side,
On that long, winding roadside.

Dimmed hopes undimmed,
Faded dreams unfaded.
A symphony undeterred,
In twilight's songs, two hearts chidden.

In the fugue of our days,
A harmony that never strays,
Our souls, two notes in this sweet lay,
Finding rhythm in each other's way.

After rain, a new start,
A fresh chapter from the very start,
Our journey, just a spark,
With promises and wishes to impart.

One and only, like wind you glide,
Through the shadows, you confide,
Lift up my head, I¡¯ll rise, spread out my wings, I¡¯ll fly high,
In your essence, I abide.

Heart wrapped with light, a fragile glow,
Through parting storms, it dares to show.
Dare not say a thousand years, but
In your presence, time takes flight.

Parting fades, a fleeting hue,
Fuge of thoughts, a dance anew,
After rain, the skies turn blue,
Promises and wishes, we pursue.

Lift up my head, towards the sky,
Spread out my wings, ready to fly,
If I can stop one heart from breaking,
Yours, it'll be, for always taking.
